<h2>Update 11.1.17</h2>

Got through the entire demo! </br>
The only question is the testing section: https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/react/testing </br>
Not sure if I should be able to see the test validation through the browser or if I'm supposed to check if the method calls are going through, in Robo 3T.</br>

<h2>10.31.17</h2>
</br>
Stuck at step 9.2!</br>
For some reason, I'm getting this error below. Need to make sure I didn't copy paste incorrectly. The app isn't crashing, and I can still log-in/log-out/create-account and I can check off tasks (no cross-out though), but I cannot use any of the other functionalities.</br>
</br>
"Error invoking Method 'Tasks.setChecked': Method 'Tasks.setChecked' not found [404]
