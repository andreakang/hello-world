# hello-world

This repo holds the code for my Code Literacy class, Fall 2017. I'll break down my files by week:

Week 1: Learn how to print 'hello world' on Python, etc.
Week 2: Learn about booleans, objects and other data types. Learn about 'raw_input' and create a fill-in-the-blank story. 
  Result 1/ Defining my a/c unit and the french fry menu next door as objects with properties.
  Result 2/ Creating a mad libs version of the Fresh Prince of Bel-air intro song.
Week 3: Learn about functions! Learn about conditionals!
  Result/ Create our own version of Pokemon in Python, playable in Terminal. Includes ASCII images, raw_input, conditionals,  
  global variables and Pyglet media player library.
Week 4: Learn about loops! Use Turtle!
  Result/ A bunch of loop functions that draw a field of flowers. Coded in Python, draw in Turtle. 
Week 5: Learn about P5, Javascript and connecting analog sensors to P5!
  Result/ We hooked up a weight scale that tells you how long it will take you to read a book (based on additional variables) 
  to P5 and created a responsive infographic.
