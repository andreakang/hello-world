This repo holds the code for my Code Literacy class, Fall 2017. I'll break down my files by week:</br>
</br>
Week 1: Learn how to print 'hello world' on Python, etc.</br>
Week 2: Learn about booleans, objects and other data types. Learn about 'raw_input' and create a fill-in-the-blank story. </br>

  Result 2/ Creating a mad libs version of the Fresh Prince of Bel-air intro song.</br></br>

  Result/ Create our own version of Pokemon in Python, playable in Terminal. Includes ASCII images, raw_input, conditionals, global variables and Pyglet media player library.</br></br>
Week 4: Learn about loops! Use Turtle!</br></br>
  Result/ A bunch of loop functions that draw a field of flowers. Coded in Python, draw in Turtle. </br></br>
Week 5: Learn about P5, Javascript and connecting analog sensors to P5!</br></br>
