To start, I started deleting lines and changing values in the original sketch file to start to understand what was happening in the code. How were these dots and colored lines being mapped? What was affecting the color? Thickness? Where were the two graphs located? </br>
From playing around with the code, I found that the graph code was at the bottom, that the "step" variable determined how far apart the mapped dots/lines were, and that the graph class was in the utils.js file. I also understood that the code was basically capturing the previous Image and comparing the new Image with the previous to understand how the Image was moving. I also learned what the translate() function was doing.</br>
I hunted through the utils.js file to find the graph class and changed the strokeWeight—then I changed the respective strokeWeight of the base lines of the graphs. I changed the stroke color of the lines that follow the Image's motion so that they are on a black & white scale and have transparency—relating to the map values of something? Maybe the zones of u and v. It seems like the zones are simply location values of u and v but I'm not 100% sure. </br>
I played around with drawing an ellipse that changes size in relation to the u and v values, instead of a line. That was fun because the width and height of the ellipse would change based on the u and v (left/right and up/down) values. But I kept the lines since it tracks directly to the moving Image.
